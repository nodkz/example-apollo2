              respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

        <code>__generated__</code> folders should be added to <code>.gitignore</code> file. It's bad
        to keep generated files in repo because it complicates code review. You need to generate
        files everytime before you build or start app in watch mode. In this repo I keep generated
        files only for demo purposes!
